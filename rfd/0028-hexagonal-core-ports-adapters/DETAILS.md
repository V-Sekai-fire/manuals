## Context and problem statement

Components in the stack span several languages (C, C++, Python,
Elixir, GDScript), run as separate processes, and each binds to
hardware, a GPU, the network, or an engine runtime. A component has to
stay testable without its device, replaceable without a rewrite of its
callers, and composable with components written in another language.
A shared monolith or a single in-memory object model does not hold
across those boundaries.

## Decision drivers

- Real-time and pipeline paths cross process and language boundaries
  with no shared object model.
- Hardware, OS, GPU, network, and engine concerns have to stay out of
  the domain logic, or that logic becomes untestable away from the
  live system.
- CI runs the domain logic against recorded fixtures, without the
  device or the runtime.
- One computed result often feeds several outputs from a single pass.

## Decision outcome

Each component is a hexagon with a uniform `core/` + `ports/` +
`adapters/` layout, and components compose into a cluster by wiring
ports across the boundary.

### core/ — dependency-free domain logic

`core/` holds the component's domain logic and nothing else: it opens
no socket, reads no device, and links no framework. It carries its own
`core/spec/` of tests that run in isolation against fixtures. A
transport never reaches into the core.

### ports/ — interface contracts, labelled by direction

A port is a narrow interface the core defines and an adapter
implements. Each port is labelled by its side of the hexagon and by
its data direction:

- driving (primary) ports carry input the outside world pushes into
  the core;
- driven (secondary) ports carry the core's output back out to the
  outside world;
- by data flow, a `*_source` port reads data in and a `*_sink` port
  writes data out.

A port stays at the lowest common denominator every binding language
can implement: a C-ABI struct of function pointers where the cluster
crosses languages, a language-native interface where it does not. One
header then binds C, C++, and Python adapters alike.

### adapters/ — concrete I/O at the edges

Adapters implement the ports against the real world: a serial device,
a UDP socket, a recorded fixture for CI, a GPU compute host, a
renderer, an engine runtime. One port admits many adapters, so a
single core output fans out to several destinations from one pass, and
a recorded-fixture adapter stands in for live hardware under CI.

### Cluster composition — wiring ports across the seam

Components compose by connecting one component's sink to another's
source. An in-process dependency links the sibling directly; a
cross-process dependency meets on a wire, a network protocol the two
ends share. The wire is the integration contract, so a producer in one
language and a consumer in another share no code, only the message
format. Each component declares its sibling wiring alongside its
ports.

## Consequences

- A dependency-free core lets CI replay recorded fixtures through the
  domain logic with no device and no runtime.
- The wire seam decouples languages and processes, so any component is
  rewritable or replaceable as long as it keeps the message contract.
- A new output is a new sink adapter, with no change to the core that
  produced the data.
- The driving and driven labels keep the dependency direction
  explicit: adapters depend on the core through ports, and the core
  depends on nothing.
- The convention costs interface boilerplate, and across a process
  boundary it adds a serialize and parse step the in-process link
  avoids. That cost buys cross-language, cross-process composition.

## More information

The `sinew-mocap` cluster applies the pattern end to end. Each
repository (`driver`, `mount_drift`, `solve`, `viewer`, `vr_bridge`)
carries the `core/` + `ports/` + `adapters/` triad; ports are
header-only C struct vtables labelled driving or driven and named
`*_source.h` / `*_sink.h` (FrameSource, TrackerSink, PoseSink,
HmdSource); adapters bind the serial dongle, a recorded `.rawlog`,
UDP, polyscope, SteamVR, OpenVR, and Vulkan; and the repositories
compose over the `/sinew` OSC wire (UDP 39539), with each
`ports/sibling-repos.txt` declaring the wiring. The synthetic-data
branch in `sinew-vrdance/pose_distill` applies the same triad in
Python: core geometry and label cleaning, ports for the teacher pose
model, renderer, and dataset sink, and adapters for the model, the
Godot renderer, and the COCO sink.
