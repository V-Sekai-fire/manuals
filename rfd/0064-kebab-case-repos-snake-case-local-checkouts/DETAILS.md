## Context and problem statement

Repositories across our orgs grew inconsistent names. The loot-action
slice under `v-sekai-multiplayer-fabric` mixed kebab-case
(`combat-core`, `loot-core`) with snake_case (`entity_packet`), and
the `sinew-mocap` org carried `mount_drift` and `vr_bridge` alongside
kebab-case peers. We want one repo-naming convention so clones, links,
and code search stay predictable.

The complication is that several C++ repos are consumed as siblings
_by directory path_. `solve/CMakeLists.txt` does
`add_subdirectory(../mount_drift …)`, CI workflows in `solve`,
`viewer`, and `packaging` check the repo out to `path: mount_drift`,
and the homebrew formula stages a `mount_drift` resource to
`../mount_drift`. Renaming the local checkout directory to kebab-case
would break every one of those hardcoded paths. So: what should repos
be named, and must the local checkout directory match the repo name?

## Decision drivers

- Repo names should be uniform and discoverable across orgs.
- The convention must not break build wiring that hardcodes sibling
  directory paths.
- Language-native package identifiers (Lean, C++) are snake_case;
  local dirs that feed the build should respect that.
- Renaming a GitHub repo is low-risk: GitHub serves automatic
  redirects from the old name, so existing clone URLs and CI checkouts
  keep working.

## Considered options

- Kebab-case everywhere — both GitHub repos and local checkout
  directories.
- snake_case everywhere.
- Kebab-case GitHub repos; local checkout directories keep
  build-native names.

## Decision outcome

Chosen option: "Kebab-case GitHub repos; local checkout directories
keep build-native names", because it gives uniform remote naming
while preserving the directory names that CMake, CI, and packaging
reference as siblings.

The rules:

- GitHub repository names are kebab-case, for example `combat-core`,
  `loot-core`, `entity-packet`, `mount-drift`, and `vr-bridge`.
- Local checkout directory names match what the build expects. Where a
  repo is consumed as a sibling by path
  (`add_subdirectory(../mount_drift)`, a CI `path:`, a homebrew
  `resource`), the local directory keeps the snake_case name the
  build hardcodes, so local `mount_drift` maps to remote
  `sinew-mocap/mount-drift`.
- Where no build path depends on the directory name, the local
  directory may match the kebab-case repo name. The loot-action slice
  directories were renamed to kebab-case on this basis
  (`combat-core`, `loot-core`, `entity-packet`, and the rest).
- Old remote URLs keep working through GitHub redirects. Update
  `origin` URLs at convenience, and leave the hardcoded `repository:`
  and `resource` strings that already resolve through the redirect.

## Consequences

- Good: remote names are uniform and code search / links are
  predictable.
- Good: a rename is just `gh repo rename` plus a local `git remote
set-url`; CI that still clones the old name keeps working through
  the redirect.
- Good: no build breakage — sibling-by-path repos retain the directory
  name the build hardcodes.
- Bad: a local directory name can differ from its remote repo name
  (`mount_drift` ↔ `mount-drift`), which can surprise newcomers.
- Bad: fully propagating kebab-case into the build files (CMake, CI,
  homebrew) would require coordinated multi-repo PRs through the merge
  queue; that is deliberately out of scope here.

## Confirmation

- `gh repo list <org>` shows no repository name matching `[_A-Z]`.
- Repos consumed as siblings by path keep their snake_case checkout
  directory, and `add_subdirectory(../mount_drift)` still resolves
  locally.
- For `sinew-mocap`: `mount_drift` → `sinew-mocap/mount-drift` and
  `vr_bridge` → `sinew-mocap/vr-bridge` were renamed on GitHub; the
  local checkout directories remain `mount_drift` and `vr_bridge`.

## More information

Relates to the org split that created `v-sekai-multiplayer-fabric` and
to the GHCR package-ownership decision; both concern how repositories
are organized and referenced. See
`decisions/20260606-org-split-v-sekai-multiplayer-fabric.md` and
`rfd/0009-ghcr-package-ownership-same-repo`.
