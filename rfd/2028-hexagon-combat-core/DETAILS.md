## Context and problem statement

The combat concern — combo timing, hit validation, the enemy
spawn-invulnerability window, and damage — needs to be deterministic
and testable with no server and no headset. Per
`rfd/201c-hexagonal-core-ports-adapters` it becomes a core behind
narrow ports.

## Decision outcome

Chosen option: structure combat as a hexagon. The core resolves the
combo timing, validates each hit against the authoritative positions,
holds the enemy invulnerable for its spawn window, and deducts health,
as a pure reducer (`rfd/2021-core-contract-pure-reducer-byte-state`)
over deterministic state
(`rfd/2022-deterministic-cores-integer-seeded-rng`).

Driving ports: `input_source` (player commands with timestamps and
targets), `tick_source` (the constant-step clock), `behavior_source`
(enemy intents). Driven ports: `state_sink` (authoritative entity
state), `event_sink` (hits, deaths, door unlocks). Adapters:
`feat/module-http3` feeds `input_source`; the `zone-server` hosts the
core and drives `tick_source` under server authority
(`decisions/20260611-server-authoritative-simulation-deferred-rollback.md`);
sandboxed behavior (`rfd/2025-generated-behavior-sandboxed-riscv`)
implements `behavior_source`; a fixture adapter replays recorded
inputs for CI.

## Consequences

- The server-authoritative adapter binds `input_source` and
  `state_sink` with interpolation and no prediction for the deadline;
  the rollback adapter lands after the gate behind the same ports.
- The combat core runs headless against fixtures, so a flaky adapter
  fails in isolation.
- The melee archetype ships first; the ranged and caster archetypes
  land after the gate.

## Confirmation

The combat core passes its fixtures, and a melee combo lands a hit
under server authority on the OpenXR client.
