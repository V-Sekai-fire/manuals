title: "RFD 0111: Convert the deployment words to the hexagon vocabulary"
rfd: "0111"
state: published
scope: architecture vocabulary across all repositories

## Problem

This stack names one component twice. RFD 0028 names its structure; a second set names its
deployment — plane, edge plane, domain — with no RFD, defined in `lib/weft.ex`, copied into
ten or more READMEs, and giving domain, edge, and port two meanings each where ASD-STE100 permits one.

## Decision

Retire plane, edge plane, and domain; the Netflix formulation supplies each replacement.

| retired     | replacement     | the meaning that carries over             |
| ----------- | --------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| plane       | interactor      | a process that holds entities and actions |
| edge plane  | transport layer | the input that triggers an interactor     |
| domain      | service         | the set that shares a ring, and a machine |
| store plane | data source     | the implementation behind a repository    |

The rules do not change with the words. An interactor opens no listening socket. A
transport layer holds no authority, runs no simulation, and keeps no durable state. A
service is the set of interactors that share a ring, because a ring is shared memory and forces
co-location. "Control plane" and "data plane" stay: they name a class of traffic rather than a
process. A git repository name states its type first and drops the `fabric-` prefix the
organisation already carries, so `fabric-authority-plane` becomes `interactor-authority`.
Thirty are renamed, five carrying no retired word.
