## One invariant at two consistency levels

|                    | Loose, between cycles                      | Claimed, at the cycle                 |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| Enforced by        | Ownership sequence number, host arbitrates | Transaction across two databases      |
| Cost               | Nothing. Rides in the state update         | About one round trip                  |
| Wrong for          | A few frames, then converges               | Never                                 |
| Checked by         | Convergence                                | `honest()`, every cycle               |
| Failure looks like | A crate snaps to another pose              | Scrip or salvage that does not add up |

The two rows describe the same rule. What differs is the price paid for it and how long it may be violated.

## What Fiedler's model supplies

Authority passes to whoever last interacted with an object, and ownership stops a second player taking it while it is
held. Both ride as sequence numbers in every state update, and the host accepts an update when its sequence is newer.
Conflicts are reported as rare in practice even under significant latency.

State is quantized identically on both sides before each physics step, at 1/1000th of a centimetre, and synchronized
at 10 Hz against PhysX's non-determinism. A priority accumulator decides which objects fit in each packet, boosting
whatever collided or was recently thrown, which gives direct control over bandwidth against a fixed packet size. Delta
compression against per-object baselines encodes an unchanged object in one bit and a ballistic-predicted object in
one more. Four players fit under 256 kbps each.

A held object leaves the physics stream entirely and rides in the holder's avatar packet as a relative transform,
which stops the hand and the object disagreeing. Avatar state arrives through a 100 ms jitter buffer.

## What the Gyre supplies

The ward is a SQLite database over a VFS whose pages live in FoundationDB, and every Spark is a database of their own.
Paying one is a transfer between two databases under the parallel commit protocol. Three invariants hold every cycle:
scrip is conserved, salvage is unique, and one seed makes one ward.

The third is what constrains this design most. A cycle may not advance on wall-clock time, and no change may alter the
RNG draw order, because `check` plays a seed twice and compares a fingerprint. A physics simulation that fed the ward
would end that check, and PhysX is the reason Fiedler rejected lockstep in the first place.

## What PRAGMATA supplies

Two characters played at once: Hugh moves, shoots and jumps while Diana hacks in real time. The interest is in the
division of attention rather than in either half alone.

The Gyre has both halves already. Hands work at frame rate, and the Queen's board of contracts, venues
and cycles runs as a discrete layer that decides what the object in a hand is worth. The claim is the moment the two
layers touch.

## The Memory Drive as the worked case

RFD 0085 has Memory Drives housing a Spark's consciousness, dropping on death, and available to be looted or ransomed.
Every property that makes an object hard here is present at once. It is holdable, so it wants distributed authority.
It is contested between players who benefit from taking it, so it cannot have distributed authority. It is unique in
the fiction as strongly as in the ledger, because duplicating a drive duplicates a person.

The split resolves it. The shell is a physics object under the ordinary rules, and custody is a row that moves only by
transaction. A player can carry, drop and hand over the shell at frame rate while the question of who owns the drive
is answered somewhere that cannot be raced.

## Failure modes to design against

A claim that inserts before it deletes duplicates the item for the width of the window. A claim that deletes before it
inserts destroys it for the same width. The parallel commit exists to make both halves land together, and the claim is
exactly the transaction it was built for.

An object committed by a cycle and still simulated afterwards exists twice, with the ledger aware of one copy. This
shows up as a violated invariant on the next cycle rather than as a visual artefact, which is the reason to prefer
this arrangement over one that reconciles later.

Distributed authority over anything priced in scrip lets a player take what they were not given. This is the whole
content of Fiedler's cooperative-only caveat applied to a setting that has an economy.

Physics feeding the seeded simulation ends the replay check silently. Nothing fails at the moment it happens, and
`check` starts disagreeing with itself on runs that used to match.

## Alternatives considered

Server-authoritative physics with client-side prediction. This removes the security caveat and the split, at the cost
of rollback and resimulation for every interaction, and of a round trip in the hands of a player holding an object.
Fiedler weighed the same trade and observed that for this class of interaction the security is effectively the same
either way, since the client is trusted about its own hands regardless.

One consistency level for everything, chosen as the strong one. Every crate becomes a transaction, and throwing
anything costs a commit. This holds every invariant and gives up the interaction the RFD exists to enable.

One consistency level for everything, chosen as the weak one. Scrip and drives converge like cubes do. This is fast,
simple, and hands the treasury to whoever writes a client.

Deterministic lockstep across all clients. This gives exactness without a ledger, and requires a deterministic physics
engine the stack does not have.
