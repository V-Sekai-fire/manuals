## Problem

`zone-server-h2o`'s PR #22 removed the MUD subsystem (the phase-2
CDN-guest move). The first cut of that PR also deleted
`thirdparty/libriscv` and `thirdparty/QCBOR`, because their only
in-tree consumer was the MUD orchestrator. That deletion was wrong,
and the review that caught it exposed an undocumented decision.

`rfd/0092` defines _how_ the host gates guest access (ReBAC, a use
plane and an admin plane). No RFD defines _what_ the host repo must
implement to close a user-generated-content game loop. No RFD says
which repo is that host, or how many guests compose in one zone.

Without that decision on record, the same mistake repeats. A cleanup
of guest-adjacent code can delete host-side machinery that looks
orphaned but is load-bearing for the loop.

## Decision

`zone-server-h2o` is the host of the minimum UGC game loop. The loop
is: a principal with administrative capability loads guest programs,
and principals with normal capability interact with what those guests
run. Guests are CDN-delivered riscv64 ELFs, not in-tree code.

### What the host keeps vendored

- `thirdparty/libriscv`: the guest execution engine. It is not
  MUD-specific.
- `thirdparty/QCBOR`: the serialization layer for the host-to-guest
  ABI. The host must speak the same CBOR encoding the guests do.

Both stay in `zone-server-h2o` even while no in-tree consumer exists.
The QCBOR build wiring stays live in `CMakeLists.txt`, so the
vendored copy compiles in CI and does not rot.

### Two capability tiers

The tiers are `rfd/0092`'s two planes, bound to the ReBAC actions
that `src/gen/rebac.{c,h}` already generates from `lean-rebac-core`:

- **Administrative capabilities** (admin plane): fetch a guest ELF,
  load it, unload it, and grant it capabilities. These map to
  `REBAC_ACTION_MODIFY`, which `Action.minRelation` gates at
  `REBAC_RELATION_OWNER`. The orchestrator runs every admin check. A
  guest never reaches this plane.
- **Normal capabilities** (use plane): the verbs a running guest
  exposes to players. These map to `REBAC_ACTION_INTERACT` and
  `REBAC_ACTION_OBSERVE`. Observe is public. Interact needs a real
  relation.

### Guest composition

One zone process loads more than one guest, each as its own
`libriscv::Machine` and its own ReBAC subject (per `rfd/0092`). The
initial composition is:

- `zone-guest-middleham`: the game-logic guest, and the first to
  load. Its ELF recipe already worked in-tree, and it is the
  smallest.
- `zone-guest-gyre`: the presentation guest (the web client and its
  deploy), CDN-delivered on the same pipeline.
- `zone-guest-godot`: Godot rv64 under `rvlinux`. This is the stress
  test of the same capability table, not a separate design.

### What closes the loop

The minimum loop closes when three items land in `zone-server-h2o`:

1. A guest loader that links `thirdparty/libriscv` and boots one
   ELF. The last loader lived in `mud/orchestrator/main.cpp` and
   moved to `zone-guest-middleham`.
2. A capability table: which host functions a loaded guest may call,
   keyed by the guest subject's ReBAC relations, with QCBOR as the
   wire format.
3. `rebac_check` call sites at both tiers: at load time (modify,
   owner only) and per guest syscall (interact or observe).

Two prerequisites sit outside those three items. First, identity:
the server's TLS cert and key are still `NULL`/`NULL`, and the admin
plane cannot authorize a subject that does not exist. Second, an
artifact to fetch: `zone-guest-middleham`'s release workflow fails on
a `fabric-godot-core@feat/sandbox` checkout for libriscv, so no guest
ELF exists on a CDN yet.

## Consequences

- The `fly/Containerfile` libriscv build and the riscv64-musl cross
  toolchain stay removed until item 1 lands. Building a static lib
  that nothing links is dead image weight.
- Repo cleanups must treat `thirdparty/libriscv` and
  `thirdparty/QCBOR` as host infrastructure, not guest leftovers.
- The client-command path (parse a datagram payload, write an entity,
  gate it with `rebac_check`) can close a create-modify-observe loop
  before any sandbox work. That path is compatible with, and smaller
  than, items 1 through 3.

## Amendment, 2026-08-07

`rfd/0107` retires `zone-server-h2o` and makes the zone server Elixir on
an epoll loop. This record's scope named the retired host. The setting,
the content, and the client survive that change. The loop stays as the intent: a principal with administrative
capability loads guest programs, and principals with normal capability
interact with what those guests run. The mechanism does not stay.
`rfd/0108` retires the libriscv runtime of `rfd/0079`, the guest gating
of `rfd/0092`, and the two guest classes of `rfd/0095`. A record that
states how an Elixir host loads a guest does not exist yet.
