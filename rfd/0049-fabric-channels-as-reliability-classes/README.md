title: "RFD 0049: Fabric channels as reliability classes, control in payload"
state: published
scope: fabric wire protocol (entity packet and channel layout)
---

## Decision

Transforms want unreliable, latest-wins delivery at tick rate; sparse
control events (a teleport vote, a loot grab) want reliable,
exactly-once delivery. Mixing both on one ordered stream lets a
reliable event head-of-line-block the transform flow, and a separate
text channel for control means two codecs to reason about. The
fabric's logical channels are the reliability classes, and the
100-byte entity packet carries everything. `FabricMultiplayerPeer`
runs one ENet host per channel, so channels are head-of-line-free:
CH_INTEREST (1) carries unreliable transforms, CH_MIGRATION (0)
carries reliable-ordered control and state. The lane is chosen with
`set_transfer_channel` plus `set_transfer_mode`; a `cmd`/`action` byte
in the payload picks the meaning within a lane. Control rides the
same packet as the transform that produced it, so a hit validates
against the exact transform and tick, atomically, with no sequence
counter or dedupe, since the transport gives exactly-once delivery
per channel. Server-to-client state (phase, grant, reject) uses the
same format under reserved global ids; a display name is a byte
field, so even names stay integral and deterministic.
