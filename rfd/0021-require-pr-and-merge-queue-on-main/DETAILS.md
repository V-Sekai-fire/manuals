## Context and problem statement

The `manuals` repo had no branch protection on `main`. Changes landed
by pushing directly or by manually merging pull requests, with no
guarantee that a PR's checks ran against the tip it was about to
join. Two PRs can each pass against an older `main` and then conflict
or break the Quarto build once both land. How should changes reach
`main` so that every merge is reviewable and tested against the tip it
will actually join?

## Decision drivers

- Every change to `main` should arrive through a pull request, not a
  direct push.
- A PR should be validated against the latest `main` before it lands.
- The team is small, so the process should add little ceremony (no
  mandatory second reviewer, no enqueue step).
- The setting should be declarative and recorded, not click-ops
  folklore.

## Considered options

- Leave `main` unprotected (status quo).
- Branch protection requiring a pull request only.
- A repository ruleset requiring a pull request plus a merge queue.
- A repository ruleset requiring a pull request plus strict required
  status checks.

## Decision outcome

Chosen option: a repository ruleset requiring a pull request plus
strict required status checks, because it keeps `main` PR-only and
tests each change against the current tip without forcing a second
reviewer or an enqueue step.

The ruleset targets the default branch with these rules:

- Block branch deletion and non-fast-forward pushes.
- Require a pull request, with `0` required approvals (review is
  allowed, not mandated).
- Require status check `prek`, with
  `strict_required_status_checks_policy` set to `true`, so a PR whose
  branch is behind `main` updates and re-runs its checks before it
  merges.

Alongside the ruleset, the repository sets `delete_branch_on_merge`, so
a merged PR's source branch is removed automatically.

### Why not a merge queue

The earlier form of this decision required a `merge_queue` rule. The
queue serializes entries and builds each against the branch tip, which
is worth its cost on a repo with enough concurrent PRs that rebasing by
hand becomes the bottleneck. This repo merges documentation changes a
few at a time, and the queue charged for capacity it never used:

- Every merge needs an explicit enqueue step, and the queue snapshots
  the PR head at enqueue time, so a late fix races the merge and can be
  orphaned.
- `gh pr merge --delete-branch` fails while a queue is enabled
  ("Cannot use `-d` or `--delete-branch` when merge queue enabled"), so
  branch cleanup has to move to the repo-level
  `delete_branch_on_merge` setting.
- The `merge_queue` rule names no CI job on its own. A ruleset carrying
  `pull_request` + `merge_queue` and no `required_status_checks` rule
  merges a PR through the queue even when every check on it failed.
  This bit two dependent repos (`taskweft/taskweft`, `taskweft/nif`).

The strict `required_status_checks` policy keeps the property the queue
was there for — a change is tested against the tip it joins — and the
enqueue discipline goes away with it.

## Consequences

- Good: `main` only changes through PRs, and a PR behind the tip
  updates and re-runs its checks before it lands.
- Good: the configuration is captured here and reproducible from the
  ruleset JSON.
- Good: merging is a single `gh pr merge` with no enqueue step and no
  dequeue-to-fix dance.
- Bad: solo edits still need a PR.
- Bad: with `0` required approvals, the rule enforces process but not
  review, so an unreviewed PR can still merge.
- Bad: strict checks re-run on update, so a burst of concurrent PRs
  costs one extra CI round per PR that falls behind, with no batching.

## Confirmation

The ruleset is active (id `17352485`). `gh api
repos/v-sekai-multiplayer-fabric/multiplayer-fabric-manuals/rulesets` lists it, a direct
push to `main` is rejected, and the rule list carries no `merge_queue`
entry:

```sh
gh api repos/<org>/<repo>/rulesets/<id> --jq '.rules[].type'
```

`gh api repos/<org>/<repo>/rulesets/<id> --jq '.rules[] | select(.type
== "required_status_checks")'` returns the rule with the expected job
names and `strict_required_status_checks_policy: true`, and a PR with a
failing check cannot merge.

`gh api repos/v-sekai-multiplayer-fabric/<repo> --jq
.delete_branch_on_merge` returns `true`, and the source branch of a
merged PR no longer exists.

## More information

The ruleset is edited with `gh api -X PUT
repos/<org>/<repo>/rulesets/<id> --input ruleset.json`. The API
replaces the whole rule array, so read the current rules first and send
back every rule to keep, not only the one being changed:

```sh
gh api repos/<org>/<repo>/rulesets/<id> --jq '.rules'
```

Job names to require come from a real PR's checks:

```sh
gh pr checks <PR-number> --repo <org>/<repo>
```

and the status-check rule takes the shape:

```json
{
  "type": "required_status_checks",
  "parameters": {
    "strict_required_status_checks_policy": true,
    "required_status_checks": [{ "context": "<job name from gh pr checks>" }]
  }
}
```

Change the policy by editing the ruleset rather than protecting the
branch through the classic branch-protection API, so the two mechanisms
do not overlap.

Apply the branch-cleanup setting declaratively:

```sh
gh api -X PATCH repos/v-sekai-multiplayer-fabric/<repo> \
  -F delete_branch_on_merge=true
```
