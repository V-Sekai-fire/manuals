title: "RFD 0063: Project state lives in repo markdown, not in agent auto-memory"
state: published
scope: project-state record keeping across agent sessions
---

## Decision

Project state lives in three versioned repo-root markdown files, not
in an agent's private auto-memory. `CHANGELOG.md` holds decisions and
completed, verified work. `OPEN_GAPS.md` holds unfinished work and
open problems. `TOMBSTONES.md` holds dead ends and disproven
hypotheses. Each fact has exactly one home, and it moves between files
as its status changes. Auto-memory stays thin: it holds only durable
behavioural rules plus one pointer telling a future session to read
the three docs first. A fact in repo markdown travels with the code
it describes, shows up in review, and goes stale visibly the moment
the code changes; a fact in private auto-memory desyncs silently,
because it is not reviewed in diffs and does not travel with the
code.
