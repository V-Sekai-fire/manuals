## FoundationDB, 7 records

CockroachDB replaces it, so `rfd/0006` returns to force.

| RFD    | Subject                                    |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| `0002` | taskweft value narrowing in FDB encoding    |

| `0103` | Uro on ecto_foundationdb                    |

## The libriscv guest runtime, 5 records

The Gyre survives. Its runtime does not.

| RFD    | Subject                                    |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| `0037` | Generated behavior as sandboxed RISC-V      |

| `0095` | Two guest classes, a domain ABI, Bubblewrap |
| `0096` | Guest transport on Fly, measured            |

## Measurements taken on the retired tier, 5 records

Each number was measured against libh2o and FoundationDB. The
measurement stands as history. It guides nothing on the new tier.

| RFD    | Subject                                |
| ------ | -------------------------------------- |
| `0098` | The rollback snapshot budget            |
| `0100` | 256 kbps per client, 47 concurrent      |
| `0101` | zstd delta on the wire                  |
| `0102` | The whole deployment on 15 USD          |
| `0104` | Hypothesis, 1000 concurrent users       |

## Records whose subject is an archived repository, 8 records

## The four that stay, and why

YAGNI keeps a record when a live consumer needs it now.

- `rfd/0005` glTF interactivity value types. `fabric-flow-adapters`
  and `fabric-flow-adapters-project` are live repositories, and this
  record describes their taxonomy.
- `rfd/0007` Godot double-precision `template_release`. The scope names
  an archived repository, and `zone-client-godot`, `zone-baker`, and
  `rfd/0031`'s merged authoring build all need double precision.
- `rfd/0045` Loot-action core-loop MVP. The record of what the game
  loop is. `rfd/0085`'s Gyre sits on this shell.
- `rfd/0067` Release tag progression. The scope names an archived
  repository, and `rfd/0090`'s live Burrito release of `uro` uses the
  convention.

## Inbound citations

53 citations in surviving files name a retired record. 16 name a full
path and become links into the archive. The rest name a bare number and
stay as citations, which follows `rfd/0106`.

`data/measurements/README.md` opens with "Measurements: rfd/0096
through rfd/0103". Both records are retired. The parquet files stay in
the manuals repository, and whether the measurement data follows its
records into the archive is open.
