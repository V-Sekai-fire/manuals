title: "RFD 0054: MCP runtime bridge for deployed builds"
state: published
scope: MCP inspection of deployed (non-editor) builds
---

## Decision

The Godot MCP addon is an editor plugin, so it drives the editor over
its `EditorInterface`. Debugging a deployed build — a headless zone
server, a mobile client, an OpenXR app — needs the same inspection
against the running game, where there is no editor. A runtime
autoload (`mcp_runtime.gd`) serves the same MCP from inside the
running game, injecting the live `SceneTree` where the editor plugin
injects the editor. An MCP client reaches it over `adb forward` (or
any port forward). Scene, node, property, `call_method`, `run_script`,
`get_render_info`, and a runtime-capable `screenshot` operate on the
running game; editor-only commands return an error. The contribution
lands upstream as `vsekai-godot-mcp#1`. A deployed OpenXR build
becomes inspectable and drivable from the workstation: frame stats,
the live scene tree, and arbitrary GDScript against the running game.
Under XR, `screenshot` reads the flat Window viewport, which stays
black because the rendered frames go to the XR compositor's per-eye
swapchain and that is not host-readable; `get_render_info` and
`run_script` cover XR diagnostics instead. Over `adb forward`,
`get_render_info` returns 13 draw calls and 46476 primitives from the
running OpenXR app, and `run_script` reads the live client state.
