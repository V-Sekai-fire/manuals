title: "RFD 0032: Core kernel codegen via lean-slang (Lean to Slang to SPIR-V)"
rfd: "0032"
state: published
scope: GPU compute kernel codegen for the hexagonal cores
---

## Decision

The cores carry compute kernels, such as hit raycasts, the budgeter
solve, and geometry costing. These kernels need one verified source. A
hand-ported shader from a separate spec can drift from that source.
The project authors each kernel in Lean and lowers it to Slang through
`lean-slang`. It then runs `slangc -target spirv` to produce SPIR-V,
and dispatches the compiled kernel behind the flat C ABI port. SPIR-V
runs the kernel on the GPU and gets the convergence integration the
CPU Slang target lacks. The `idtx-flow` repository already depends on
`LeanSlang` and byte-pins the emitted Slang against the committed
source with `native_decide`. The project commits the lowered Slang and
the compiled SPIR-V, and byte-pins both, so a drifting regeneration
fails the pin. The kernels use integer operations only, so the SPIR-V
output stays deterministic across conformant devices.
