title: "RFD 0067: Release tags progress chronologically through dev, beta, rc, and release"
rfd: "0067"
state: published
scope: fabric-godot-packaging release tag convention

## Decision

Release tags for `fabric-godot-packaging` use semver pre-release
identifiers: `v<major>.<minor>.<patch>-<stage>.<N>` for a pre-release,
and the bare `v<major>.<minor>.<patch>` for a final release. The stage
runs `dev`, `beta`, `rc`, then release; the counter stays unpadded,
because ordering does not depend on it. Tags are always created in
forward chronological order, so `git tag --sort=creatordate` recovers
the correct progression. Neither plain lexicographic sort nor
`--sort=version:refname` gives the right cross-stage order: `beta`
sorts before `dev` alphabetically even though it comes later in the
pipeline, and bare `v0.1.0` sorts before every suffixed pre-release
form as a string prefix. The `version` workflow input maps directly to
`LOOP_PKG_VERSION`; any version containing a `-` builds as a
pre-release, and a bare version builds as a full release.
