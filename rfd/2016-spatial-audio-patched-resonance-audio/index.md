title: "RFD 2016: Spatial audio via a patched Resonance Audio (HRTF and audio probes)"
rfd: "2016"
state: published
scope: engine audio module (feat/module-resonance-audio)
---

## Problem

The zone server needs binaural HRTF rendering and audio probes for
occlusion. Godot's built-in `AudioServer` gives neither feature.
Google also archived the Resonance Audio project upstream, so no
maintained upstream source remained to build this on.

## Decision

The zone server needs binaural HRTF rendering and audio probes for
occlusion, and Godot's built-in `AudioServer` gives neither. The
engine vendors a patched Resonance Audio as an engine module
(`feat/module-resonance-audio`), driven by a spatial-audio server
(`feat/spatial-audio-server`) that places sources and listeners and
resolves probes per frame. Google archived Resonance Audio upstream,
so the fork owns the code; the patch set rebases against no moving
upstream, and the module targets the frozen Godot 4.7 pin, so it does
not chase engine movement either. The `sponza-godot-audio` repo is the
demo and benchmark scene.
