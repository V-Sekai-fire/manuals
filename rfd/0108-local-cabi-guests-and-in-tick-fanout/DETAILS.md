## The measurements this rests on

Every number comes from `rfd/0097` and `rfd/0096`. One ZoneTick at
64 Hz is 15.6 ms.

| Path                                  | Median     | Fraction of one tick |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------- | -------------------- |
| FDB watch fire, publish to subscriber | 12214.3 us | 78 percent           |
| FDB commit, one publish               | 3552.9 us  | 23 percent           |
| FDB versionstamp log append           | 2509.5 us  | 16 percent           |
| `AF_UNIX` round trip, from `rfd/0096` | 8.9 us     | 0.06 percent         |

A local C ABI call removes the 8.9 us hop as well, because the guest
shares the address space.

## Why watches stay unused

Three facts from `rfd/0097` rule them out, and each one is enough:

- The watch path is about 1371 times slower than an `AF_UNIX` round
  trip.
- The probe held exactly 10000 concurrent watches, then failed with
  error 1032, `Too many watches currently set`. That cap belongs to the
  database, and a fabric of many zones shares it.
- A watch is edge-triggered. It reports that a key changed, not what
  the value became. A subscriber re-reads the key, and values that
  change between the fire and the re-read are lost.

The third fact is the one that disqualifies a watch as an event stream,
independent of speed.

## The ring, and why one writer

The tick is the only writer, so the write side needs no lock. A reader
holds a cursor, and it advances at its own rate.

Serializing once is the point. Fan-out to N subscribers costs one
serialization and N pointer writes, rather than N serializations. The
packet is 100 bytes and integral, per `rfd/0053`, so a subscriber reads
the same bytes the wire carries.

## Wakeup batching

A cross-loop delivery needs a wakeup, and a wakeup is a syscall. One
wakeup per message does not hold at this rate.

Signal a loop once per tick instead, after the ring advances. At 64 Hz
that caps a loop near 64 wakeups per second, whatever the message
count.

## Back-pressure, which needs a rule per channel

A lagging reader must never stall the writer. A cursor that falls out
of the ring gets dropped, and the subscriber receives a resync signal
rather than a gap.

`rfd/0049` makes fabric channels reliability classes, and that gives
the rule its vocabulary. A state channel may drop, because the next
tick supersedes the last one. A control channel may not drop, so it
needs its own path rather than the ring.

## The sandbox this removes

A local `.so` shares the zone's address space. A guest fault takes the
zone down, and a guest reads any memory the zone holds.

`rfd/0083` chose Fil-C for memory safety against untrusted client
input. `rfd/0095` built two guest classes for the same reason. Local
mode has neither property.

That is correct for first-party simulation code, which the project
writes and builds. It is wrong for user-generated code. `rfd/0094`'s
UGC loop therefore needs a mechanism this record does not supply.

## What this resolves in RFD 0107

Two of the four open questions close.

The tick drives the `libfdb_c` callbacks, and h2o's ingress loop does
not. The callback chain of `rfd/0073` moves with the tick, and the
durable append runs off-tick.

The guest boundary sits in-process, over the C ABI, for simulation
guests.

Two questions stay open, and one arrives.

Where Elixir and `zone-backend` sit is unchanged by this record.

Which part terminates a WebTransport session stays open, and it now
matters more. This record binds a subscriber to the loop that owns its
connection. `rfd/0097` states that the zone server holds subscriber
connections through picoquic and WebTransport, and `rfd/0088` chose
picoquic over h2o's own QUIC. So the owning loop is h2o's thread for
HTTP and picoquic's loop for WebTransport. Whether those unify decides
how many cross-loop wakeups a tick needs.

How a UGC guest runs is the new question. Local mode does not sandbox,
so the UGC loop needs its own record.
