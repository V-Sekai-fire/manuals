# Game-loop-first delivery sequence

## The Context

The team polled on which concern to stabilise next. Game-loop received 2 of 4 votes (50%). The uiux-polish, cassie-pen-mesh, shop-economy, and openUSD-i/o concerns all require a verified game-loop as their integration target and are not testable end-to-end without one.

## The Problem Statement

The uiux-polish, cassie-pen-mesh, shop-economy, and openUSD-i/o concerns have no stable integration target while the game-loop remains unverified. Work that lands on an unstable loop accumulates rework debt that blocks the feedback release.

## Design

The OpenXR Windows build (export preset `OpenXR`, `build/openxr/loop-slice.exe`) is the external feedback artifact. It runs the full hub-to-field-to-loot round trip and is the SteamVR-compatible path for PCVR reviewers.

The game-loop is complete when `smoke.sh` passes, the OpenXR Windows build exports without error, and at least one external reviewer runs the full loop against a live server.

## The Downsides

The shop-economy and openUSD-i/o concerns have no integration path before the feedback release. If the game-loop verification slips, all four dependent concerns slip with it and there is no parallel path to absorb the delay.

## The Road Not Taken

- Parallel concerns: advancing uiux-polish or cassie-pen-mesh alongside the game-loop risks landing polish or authoring work on a loop that is still changing, producing rework.
- Content-first: stabilising content concerns before the loop pushes integration gaps late, when they are most expensive to fix.
