## Context

The zone server binary was built by `multiplayer-fabric-baker` and pushed to `ghcr.io/v-sekai-fire/godot-zone-double`. The zone deploy workflow (in `multiplayer-fabric-zone`) used `--local-only` with `docker/login-action` to pull that image, but received 403 Forbidden.

GitHub Container Registry ties package write access to the repository whose `GITHUB_TOKEN` created it. The zone repo's token could not push to a package owned by the baker repo, and could not pull a private package owned by another repo without package-scoped access.

## Decision

Each repository builds and publishes the GHCR images it directly uses in its own deploy:

- `multiplayer-fabric-baker` builds and owns `godot-editor-double`.
- `multiplayer-fabric-zone` builds and owns `multiplayer-fabric-zone-godot` (renamed from `godot-zone-double` to reflect ownership).

`workflow_run` triggers only fire within the same repository, so the zone binary build workflow must live in the zone repo for the deploy to auto-trigger after a successful build.

## Consequences

- Package names must reflect the owning repo to avoid confusion.
- Moving a package between repos requires deleting it (needs `delete:packages` API scope) and rebuilding, or renaming.
- Cross-repo GHCR access requires either a PAT with `read:packages` scope or making the package public.
