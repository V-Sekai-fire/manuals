## Context and Problem Statement

The cores carry compute kernels — hit raycasts, the budgeter solve, geometry costing — that need to be verified once and run as GPU compute, with the dispatch wrapped behind the flat C ABI port ([the Lean cores decision](20260611-lean4-kernel-cores-flat-c-host-adapters.md)). Hand-porting a kernel from a separate spec to a shader drifts.

## Decision Drivers

- One verified Lean source per kernel, with no separate shader to drift.
- The kernel runs on the GPU and integrates with GPU convergence; the CPU Slang target lacks that integration.
- Integer ops keep the kernel deterministic across conformant devices.

## Considered Options

- Hand-write each kernel as a shader from a separate spec.
- Lower a CPU host target through Slang.
- Author the kernel in Lean and lower it to SPIR-V.

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: author the compute kernels in Lean and lower them to Slang through [lean-slang](https://github.com/V-Sekai-fire/lean-slang), then run `slangc -target spirv` to SPIR-V (`.spv`), and dispatch the `.spv` behind the flat C ABI, because SPIR-V runs the kernel on the GPU with the convergence integration the CPU Slang target lacks, and one verified Lean source produces the shipped kernel. The `idtx-flow` repository already depends on `LeanSlang` and byte-pins the emitted Slang against committed source with `native_decide`.

## Consequences

- One Lean kernel source produces the `.spv`, so the spec and the shipped kernel stay one artifact.
- The lowered Slang and the `.spv` are committed and byte-pinned, so a regen that drifts fails the pin.
- The kernels use integer ops, so the SPIR-V stays deterministic across conformant devices ([the determinism decision](20260611-deterministic-cores-integer-seeded-rng.md)).

## Confirmation

The emitted Slang matches its committed byte-pin, and the dispatched `.spv` kernel passes the core fixtures.
