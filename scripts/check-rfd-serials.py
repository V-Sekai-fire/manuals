"""Check the serial register against the tree, and against its own last revision.

RFD 2000 gives the rule. A serial is allocated once, and it names one document
for as long as the arc under the PEN exists. This gate is what makes that
enforceable rather than agreed.

The register is `SERIALS.usda`, in Essential Tuple Normal Form: one typed array
per column, parallel by index, no nulls and nothing derivable stored. A count
is `len()` of a column rather than a number somebody maintains beside it. USD
type-checks the arrays on read, which a markdown table cannot do.

This site's register holds this site's serials and no other site's. A site that
copied another's rows would be a second record of the same fact, and the first
one to be edited would win by accident.
`request-for-discussion/pen-66606.usda` composes the sites with sublayers, which is USD doing the join
rather than a human doing the copy.

The second check is the one that matters. A renumbering removes serials from
the register and adds others in their place, so it fails on the removals. A
retitle keeps the serial and changes the slug, so it passes. The difference
between the two is the whole point of the register.

Run --self-test to see each check reject a known-bad input, because a check
that passes on broken input certifies the defect instead of catching it.
